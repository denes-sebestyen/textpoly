Textpoly
========

This is a library that
  enables the developer
    to create polygons
      with text in it
        in an SVG doc

The description above could be easily written in a trapezoid.

However it's definitely possible to create a concave polygon and write in it, From readibility (and thus a11y) point of view it's not advised to do so. Sometimes it's better to create two or more polygons next to each other and use them as text columns
